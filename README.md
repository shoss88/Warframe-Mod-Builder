# Warframe-Mod-Builder
This is a website that can help simulate character building in the video game Warframe without the user needing to fully invest hours of their time in obtaining mods. The site takes into account mod cost, polarity, and stat impacts.

Used Github Pages to host the site: https://shoss88.github.io/Warframe-Mod-Builder/
